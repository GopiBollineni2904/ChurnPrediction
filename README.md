# ChurnPrediction
Churn prediction is simply a process of forecasting your business’ churn rates in the future based on historical or current data.

In case you do not know what churn rate is, it is a metric that measures the rate at which your business is losing its customers (subscribers).

Here are some steps to help you predict your churn:
  Collect churn data: You can calculate your churn rate using the traditional way that I’ve explained in this answer. Gather data on factors such as
        # Customer engagement
        # Usage of different features
        # Contact frequency with your business - support tickets, live chat, emails, etc
        # Payment - collect data on how regularly your subscribers pay you
  List down the features of your solution that are most used by your customers
  Collect data on the users who are not engaging with your product’s best features - this usually means they’re not getting any significant value from your business
  Turn those numbers into a visual format to get an overview on exactly which points you’re losing your customers.
